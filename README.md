# DDLO
*Distributed Deep Learning-based Offloading for Mobile Edge Computing Networks*

Python code to reproduce our works on Deep Learning-based Offloading for Mobile-Edge Computing Networks [1], where multiple parallel Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used to efficiently generate near-optimal binary offloading decisions. This project includes:

- [memory.py](memory.py): the DNN structure for the DDLO, inclduing training structure and test structure

- [data](./data): all data are stored in this subdirectory, includes:

  - **data_#.mat**: training and testing data sets, where # = {10, 20, 30} is the user number

- [main.py](main.py): run this file, inclduing setting system parameters
